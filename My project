In this project, I performed data analysis using Python, focusing specifically on discovering correlations between different variables to identify factors that significantly 
impact the target outcome. I started by cleaning and analyzing the data using a correlation matrix, which allowed me to understand the interrelationships between variables.
Additionally, I explored the difference between correlation and causation to pinpoint which variables were strongly correlated and potentially influential in future 
predictions.

A key part of this project involved applying machine learning, where I selected important variables for the training model.
While I haven't fully completed training the model yet, I am very happy with the progress made so far.

I would like to express my deep gratitude to Tuwaiq Academy for giving me this wonderful opportunity to learn and grow in the field of 
data science and machine learning using Python.
